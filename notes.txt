OPTION 1

1)  Set up a repo and make some commits on my local machine,
2)  Create a new empty repo on a hosting services server.
3) Then add the new repo as a remote on my local repo and push my commits there.

Using the git bash command line to initialize a new project

1)  Create a new project in atom:   open gitbash console in windows.  use ls and cd to get into the project directory
2) git init [enter]
3) git status to see what files are tracked/untracked  [enter]
4) git add <name of file>   [enter]

repeat  git status and git add <name of file> as needed

5) git commit -m "<message>"

if first time, need to set up git config for email and name: instructions on screen
if first time, press arrow key until git commit command appears from earlier, or retype command [enter]

6) if needed, make changes, then type git status [enter]

7) git add <name of file>   [enter]

8) git status to ensure all files were committed and directory is clean.


We are now on step 2 for we have just initialized and made some initial commits to our local repo.

1)  Set up a repo and making some commits on my local machine
2)  Create a new empty repo on github.
3) Then I add the new repo as a remote on my local repo and 	push my commits there.


1)  Create a new repository on github:   name it   (if mutiple words, separate with dashes)
2)  click <create a repository>  at the bottom of the page




1)  Set up a repo and make some commits on my local machine,
2)  Create a new empty repo on a hosting services server.
3) Then add the new repo as a remote on my local repo and push my commits there.


1)  since we already have an existing repository, we want section 2:
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line

so from the gitbash we type:
git remote add origin https://github.com/milesmgit/meal-profiler.git
git push -u origin master

2)  type in user name and password in the popup box




3) make changes to the project via step one, and when ready to push to the remote on github:

4)  type  <git push> [enter]   username and password if prompted
